# Classification vs. Regression: How To Decide for Your Business Problem

How do you determine whether your business data and question require a **classification** model or a **regression** (continuous) model?  
It all comes down to the **nature of your target variable**—the output you wish to predict.

## 1. 🏷️ Examine the Target Variable

- **Classification Problem:**
  - Target is **categorical**—distinct labels or classes.
  - Examples: Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam, Disease/No Disease, Low/Medium/High, Red/Green/Blue.
  - Typical algorithms: Logistic regression, decision trees (classification), random forest (classification), classification SVM, neural net classifiers.

- **Regression (Continuous) Problem:**
  - Target is **numeric** (can take many continuous values).
  - Examples: House price, revenue, temperature, sales amount, probability estimates.
  - Typical algorithms: Linear regression, regression trees, random forest (regression), SVR (regression).

## 2. 📶 Special Cases

- **Ordinal Data:**  
  Categories have order (e.g., 1, 2, 3 stars). Can use ordinal classification or regression depending on analysis.
- **Count Data:**  
  Predicting counts (e.g., number of purchases). Can use Poisson regression, or sometimes classification if count set is small.

## 3. 🛠️ Practical Clues

- If the prediction is a **“label,” “class,” or “category,”** → **Classification**
- If the prediction is a **number** (possibly fractional), → **Regression**

| Business Question                        | Problem Type               |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Will customer churn? (Yes/No)             | Classification             |
| Will loan default?                        | Classification             |
| What will the sale price be?              | Regression                 |
| How many items will be sold?              | Regression (or count)      |
| Which product will the customer pick?     | Classification             |
| What is the probability a user clicks?    | Regression (probability), sometimes binned to classification   |

## 5. ➡️ Quick Decision Flow

- **Is the answer a number?** → **Regression**
- **Is the answer a label/class/category?** → **Classification**

For evaluation:
- “How close is my predicted NUMBER to the actual value?” → Regression accuracy (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
- “How often did I guess the CATEGORY correctly?” → Classification accuracy (e.g., accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC)

---

## 📝 Summary

- **Classification:** Predicts classes/categories.
- **Regression:** Predicts continuous numbers.

*Define your business question and check your target variable.*

**Use regression when you’re after numbers; use classification when you’re after categories.**
