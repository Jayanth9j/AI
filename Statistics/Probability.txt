Probability
Random Experiment - A experiment where can't predict the outcomes 
Example- Before watching a movie and trying to predict how it ends 
Random Variable - It assigns a numerical value to the outcome 
Basic Outcome - Final outcome which we get Ex- Happy ending hero alive 
Population - All the possibles outcomes 
Example- Generally how any movie ends
Sample space - A subset of all the outcomes 
Example- Endings of a movie in that genre 
Event - type of outcome which we want to achieve which is a subset of sample space 
Example- Movie ends with hero's death
Discrete Random Variable - It can be a finite or complete number 
Example- whether my prediction right or wrong (0/1) 
Contnious Random Variable - It can be a finite number with infinite values 
Example- movie rating 
Probability Mass Function - it is for each specific outcome (discrete random variable) 
Example- whether my prediction is right or wrong do it 50 times and i was 20 times correct 
Probability Density Function - it is between a interval (continous random variable) 
Example- generally i give movie rating of avg 7 and trying to predict whether the rating for this will be in that range  
Probability Discrete Distribution - probabilties for all the possible outcomes 
Example- my prediction right or wrong (0/1) P(1)-0.5 P(0)-0.5 always equal to 1 
Probability Continous Distribution - probabilty of continous variable in a certain range 
Example- my rating whether it is between 6<X<8 or X=7  
Cummilative Distributive Function - tells cumilative probability up to the point 
Example- trying to find probablity of my movie rating less than 5 to equal to 9 P(5<x<9)
