Set Theory 

Collection - It contains random elements 

Example- All movies

Set - It contains well defined elements 

Example- All Action genre movies

Conditional Probability - It means the probability of an event occuring based on another event which has already occured

Example - i will mi 8 movie if the review is 8.1

Expected Value - Average of outcomes of random variables over time (in case of discrete variables it is generally mean)

Example - finding how many times the fan turns on 20 attempts

Mean - Average 

Variance - it measures how the data spreads(deviate) from mean 

Standard Deviation - measures how far data spread(deviate) from mean 

Bernoulli Distribution - One time experiment with only two possible outcomes (Success or failure)

Example- Switch on a fan to see whether is working or not working

Binomail Distribution- N times experiment with number of success occured 

Example - Switching on a fan 20 times to see whether is working or not working

Normal Distribution - A bell shaped curve from which we can say from the values are spread around mean

Example - Height
